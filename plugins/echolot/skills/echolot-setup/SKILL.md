description: Build echolot.yml for an Android project — a repository scan, a probe trace, and a few questions only the human can answer. The echolot skill routes here when the project has no config.

# Setup

Run `echolot guide setup` and follow it. The installed echolot prints it, so
it matches the commands you are about to run.

What it rests on: **the human does not open the config.** Take everything
the repository and a probe trace can give — `echolot scan`, a probe capture,
`echolot probe`, `echolot names`, `echolot domains --root .` — and ask only
what exists in neither.

Ask one question at a time. Each is a choice among options taken from the
trace, with a default, and you wait for the answer before the next. You
present candidates and the human decides; a value nobody could find is
written as `null` and said out loud, never invented.

Before calling the config done, `echolot analyze` the probe trace and read
the window, not the findings: `start_anchor.matches` above zero, a window
that looks like the scenario, and not every detector firing at once. Then
`echolot` should say `next: hunt`.
